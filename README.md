### Areas of focus 
● Familiarize oneself with the important elements for developing a community data dashboard
● Recognize different principles (e.g., co-design, user-centered design) that can be used to develop dashboards
● Learn how to implement and evaluate community dashboards in an active community-based RCT study
● Consider different facets of sustainability around long-term use of community dashboards 

### Overivew
There is a notable dearth of scientific evidence that examine and document the approach to design and use dashboards in community settings.[[1-4]](#1) This is concerning because there is recognition that vast amounts of data are becoming freely accessible in the public health domain; albeit, challenges with comprehending these data persist. As part of the National HEALing Communities Study (HCS), the consortium of researchers developed the Communities That Heal (CTH) dashboards across four research sites: New York, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and Ohio, that were part of the HCS to support data driven decision-making for the opioid overdose crisis.[[5]](#5) Our team was involved in the community-centered design and implementation of these data dashboards and their sustained use beyond HCS.[[6]](#6)

This workshop is divided into the following modules: Data acquisition and quality, co-designing dashboards, implementing and using dashboards in the community, best practices for dashboard use, and sustaining the enterprise. Our team will walk the audience through every step we undertook in the development of our CTH dashboards, including the acquisition of data, operationalization and specification of the data, design and refinement of dashboard components, and implementation and assessment of dashboard use across communities. We aim to provide audience members a hands-on experience needed to replicate our process for similar extensions specific to their work. We will foster a community of practice based on group discussions that will promote documentation and exchange of tools and ideas on the use of data dashboards for community decision-making.

# Module 1
  
## Module 1: Data acquisition and quality – Lead: Daniel Harris

An effective dashboard depends upon meaningful and timely data. There are many publicly available reports related to the opioid overdose crisis; these are free to use, simple to adopt, yet may not be timely or available at the community level. The timeliest and contextually relevant data may be available through establishing partnerships with state and local governments; data acquisition is an understated barrier of effective dashboards. A data use agreement (DUA) between research teams and external partners outlines the expectations and fair use of shared data. We will discuss and give examples of key elements that DUAs should contain for the protection of both partners. This includes establishing who specifically the partners are and what specific data elements are to be shared. Stipulations for secondary sharing of data and/or aggregated findings must be established. To protect the privacy of individuals, a partner may require the suppression of data points meeting some type of condition, such as aggregate counts smaller than a stated threshold. Furthermore, care must be given to avoid situations where a suppressed total would be deducible from other non-suppressed totals.

Once the use of data has been permitted by established DUAs, the logistics of acquiring data must be sorted out with partners, who may operate at different levels of technical sophistication. We will summarize different techniques for acquiring data and summarize their impact on automation. We will discuss transmission of data via e-mail, file transfer, and application programming interfaces (APIs) and their interactions with common data automation tools. The data acquired from partners is largely raw data that needs processing and analyzed into the specific measurable data points needed by the dashboards. Dashboard creation may be streamlined by standardizing the research study's measures into a common data model; we will discuss the HCS common data model and how different concepts (e.g., overdose deaths, naloxone distributions, and opioid prescriptions) may utilize the same data structure. We will also cover data linkage and harmonization as part of this discussion. Data quality checks are required at each step of the pipeline from receiving data, analyses, and publishing data to the dashboards; we will discuss how these may be automated as part of a comprehensive data pipeline, including rules, completeness, accuracy, consistency of data elements, and actions taken to address such issues. We will discuss the tradeoffs between ethics and implementation at different stages of dashboard design; we will highlight key ethical considerations related to data collection, storage, and sharing as part of this process.

# Module 2

## Module 2: Co-designing dashboards – Lead: Elwin Wu

Each of the four HCS research sites relied on their own unique set of technical approaches and solutions to develop, publish, and manage the data dashboards. Albeit, all of the sites were required to conform to some high level principles (e.g., user-centered design at first, human-centered design by the end of the study), study requirements (e.g., minimum set of required/key metrics, access privileges and account management/monitoring, compliance with HCS style guide), and phases of development that allowed for communities to provide input into the common and local preferences (e.g., design, content, and functions of the dashboard and elements within data visualizations), a process that results in what the HCS has designated as “co-creation of dashboards.” This module will compare and contrast the experience from the four sites, and discuss considerations, insights, lessons learned, and best practices with respect to software and design considerations; eliciting, responding to, challenges, and solutions to the co-creation process; and how all of these relate and interact from a human-centered design perspective.

# Module 3

## Module 3: Implementing and using dashboards in the community – Leads: Marc LaRochelle and Peter Balvanz 

Password-protected dashboards were introduced to HCS communities by community-specific data managers hired to share data and promote data driven decision-making. Community coalition rosters were consulted to provide dashboard access, and new members could request access. For most communities, dashboard introduction occurred during monthly coalition meetings when data managers could provide an orientation to the tool; dashboards were revisited monthly during coalition meetings to note new trends to discuss. We identified numerous barriers and facilitators to use through interviews with coalition members and community staff, as well as debriefs with implementing staff. Barriers included accessibility of dashboard, poor timing of data delivery, lack of utility, time constraints, and misalignment of dashboard as a tool. Facilitators included staff support to access and navigate dashboards as well as staff explaining trends they see. As a result of these lessons, numerous changes were introduced at the study and site-specific level. This module will provide qualitative evidence based on exemplary quotes from end-users for the themes identified as barriers and facilitators to dashboard use. We will also present an example from one of the sites, Massachusetts, where a process was developed that was staged and engaging to the communities to facilitate the introduction of the data to start a discussion on the gaps in opioid use disorder services revealed by the data and opportunities which the intervention could address.

# Module 4

## Module 4: Best practices for dashboard use – Leads: Naleef Fareed and Tim Huerta

Our team used a mixed-methods approach to collect formative data on the usability of the HCS dashboards across communities from all four sites. This module will discuss the design of the study and, as a follow-up to many of the themes noted in module 3, describe prioritized gaps in the usability of the dashboards and a set of best practices in data dashboard design and use for community end-users – including a pragmatic postmortem of our intended goals around co-creation of dashboards as noted in module 2. We will describe important themes that highlight the delicate balance between prioritizing community needs and research goals when introducing dashboard interventions in this module. Audience members will also be provided with tabletop examples of different formats of data visualizations around a set of metrics to demonstrate use of heuristics to establish preferred design considerations.

# Module 5

## Module 5: Sustaining the dashboard enterprise – Leads: Site Leads (Huerta, LaRochelle, Wu, Harris)

In this module, we describe three dissemination tools from our work to support community-based decisionmaking projects. We will describe and discuss the use of these tools in different public health scenarios. From our discussion with the audience, we aim to capture critical strategies for local buy-in for sustaining the use of dashboards. This real time feedback will subsequently be integrated in our dissemination toolkit that will be shared with the AMIA community for future reference.

A summary of the discussion that took place at the workshop will be included post-workshop.

## Discussion 
Dashboards can be an evidence-based approach to influence public awareness, decision-making, and for focusing resources and interventions in health care for specific populations.[[7,8]](#7) For example, public health agencies across the nation have communicated health data about the COVID-19 pandemic through dashboards – using these as tools to generate awareness and motivate behavior change.[[2,3,9]](#2) Additional applications of dashboards in the community include monitoring vaccine distribution and food insecurity. Our workshop will fill two critical gaps: 1) increase audience awareness of the inner workings of maintaining community dashboards across diverse communities; allowing audience members to identify and learn about mission critical factors that they can subsequently explain to their stakeholders when developing similar platforms; and 2) provide the audience with a set of tools on the pragmatic and systematic design, development, and deployment of data dashboards to support data driven community decision-making. There is a critical need to incorporate best practices in this field. Current practices around community dashboard development and use need thoughtful approaches that support meaningful use of these tools and data visualized, and ensure sustained, engaged use among community end-users. Our five-module workshop -- focused on data acquisition and quality, co-design of dashboards, and implementation and sustained use of dashboards – will help participants gain expert insight on how to effectively engage with these critical concepts on community dashboard development that leverage knowledge from multiple disciplines (informatics, public and community health, clinical and behavioral health, social work, and user experience) and unique applications from the four HCS sites. 

### Conclusion
Our implementation of the CTH data dashboards began in 2020, and our approach is noteworthy because of the national impact and the intended use across diverse communities. The CTH dashboards have a broad reach among several stakeholder groups, which include policy makers and community and public health practitioners. Our efforts to develop a community of practice and disseminate our experience will maximize the benefits of using community data dashboards in other settings. Participants will be encouraged to share their insights on developing similar dashboards to enhance the collective knowledge of the audience and foster a community of practice beyond the workshop session. All panel members have collaborated on the HCS national portal and dashboard work group for the past three years and have expert knowledge with community dashboard design and implementation.
